                <p> MY Name is G. Aaron Saye jr <br> 
                    I was born on to the Union of Mr. and Mrs. Gboko.
                    I was born At the Ganta united Methodist Hospital, Located in Ganta city, Nimba county Liberia.<br>
                    I’m a Liberian, I started my primary education at the Christian foundation High School and I later Enroll to the Ganta unity Methodist High School were I Graduated and got my diploma.<br> I always wanted to learn how to code but, it was not my intension to become and programmer, I always wanted to become a public administrators.<br> But after I got promoted to the 10th Grade my plan for being a public administrator change and I started working on being a Software engineer.
                    What really change my plan was, I once watch a video of a Motivational speaker, the video was all about don’t just build interest in what you like but build interest in what you think suit you the most.<br> After watching that short video I decided to think about me and what really suit me the most.<br> After all my time spent thinking on what suit me the most, I came up with a conclusion and said to myself that software engineer is what suit me the most. After that I started thinking as a software engineer and working to develop as a software engineer.
                    After I graduated from high school, I taught it wise that going out in a different place or country to learn the key things that will make me a software engineer will really be great.<br> I choose Ghana as the best place to come and explore. And I’m very happy with my decision after all. I have not spend 10th month at (IPMC) but at least I can defend myself with the few code  I have learn, and people will  know that my time in (IPMC) was not a waste. <br><br>
